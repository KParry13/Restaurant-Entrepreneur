# As a developer, I want to create an Order Factory class with a static create_order method
# As a developer, I want to utilize a Factory Pattern in the create_order() method 
#         to instantiate instances of the three different Order child classes.
# This method should accept a string as a parameter (ex “Pizza”) 
#         and return the corresponding type of Order child class instantiation (ex Pizza() )

class OrderFactory:
    # reference slide 5 in static method powerpoint
    @staticmethod
    def create_order(choice):
        pass
